# Pylox

An interpreter to Bob Nystrom's Lox language.

## Executing

I recommend crating a symlink to a folder that's in your $PATH. In my case, I've created "~/.persobin" for my personal binaries or symlinks.

Then just run (linux) `ln pylox.sh /path/to/dir/pylox` to add a link to the shell script.

After that you can run the interpreter on the command line using:

`pylox file.lox`
